Spreadsheet Data Analysis: Project

Overview:
The project task was to analyze airbnb data and find which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive and how much money was mad. 

Summary:
In the analysis of NYC Airbnb data I found the top ten neighborhoods with high rental demand. Harlem, Hells Kitchen, and Lower East Side being the top three. One bedroom properties are the most common in the top neighborhoods. The revenue for 1 bedroom properties is the highest compared to other property sizes.
